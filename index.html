                <p>Spot Seeker is an Android app for exploring beautiful places. Users help each other find the best spots nearby. Spot Seeker allows users to drop a pin at their location and mark it as a Spot. A Spot will store the coordinates and a picture that the user takes when creating the Spot. Users who visit another user's Spot may then rate that Spot and add their own photos of the location while they are within that Spot's vicinity. Spot Seeker is also my first native Android app developed using Android Studios.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <p>Answers From All is a web app with a simple mission: "Ask big questions. Explore all answers." AFA asks the kind of questions that truly explore the identity of an individual. People's answers to these questions are quite revealing of who they are and the perspectives they have. Each question has its own page where all the answers are anonymously and openly displayed for anyone to see. The answers can sortable by time or number of favorites, can be filtered to show only the user's answers, or can be randomly shuffled. Users may answer any question and favorite any answer. The web app was built using React and Parse in tandem.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <p>Less is More is a simple build tool that can lint, minify, and serve. And it's free to fork on Github! The package designed to help developers get started creating fast using the bare bones basics: raw HTML, CSS, and JS. The index.html file has probably every tag you need in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for great SEO practices. There's also a <code>manifest.json</code>, a <code>manifest.webapp</code>, and a <code>browserconfig.xml</code> along with other boilerplate files to boot. Keeping with the Less is More theme, this build tool just uses npm scripts -- no Grunt or Gulp bloat. You only need to remember 3 CLI commands: one linting, one for launching a server, and one for distribution.</p>

          <p>HapiDaily stands for "have a positive impact daily". For this project I compiled 365 simple, easy ways to make life a better, happier experience. I put this list of ways into a calendar and put it up on the site along with a social media feed from Twitter and Facebook. Any tweet that with a #HapiDaily will show up on the Twitter feed, and any posts made to the Facebook page show up in the other feed. Finally and most importantly, I made it possible for users to simply text "hapidaily" to 84483 for daily text notifications. Join in!</p>

        <div class="details">
          <p>Sound in Silence Recordings is a recording studio in Princeton, IL. While working alongside the owner (a longtime friend), Aaron Isaacson, I took what used to be a very simple, static HTML, centered layout site and turned it into an awesome, new, dynamic and responsive site built on WordPress (the most common CMS on the web). This was also my first time attempting a single page site, and I am really happy with the layout I chose.</p>

          <p>During a Scripting Languages class, I was given the task of creating a form that would take user input and output a visualization of the data, so this was the result. "Time" is a web app that gives users a new perspective on how long events in life actually are through the use of colorful, graphic representations. This was also my first exposure to jQuery Mobile, which was fun to experiment with.</p>

        <div class="details">
          <p>For my junior level Media Authoring class, I was put into a group with two other students and given about two months to make an 2D infinite-runner game for Android tablets using Unity. To determine the theme of our game, our teacher had us draw an adjective and a noun from a hat. We pulled "whistful stairs" out, and came up with the game, Ascend. In the game, you play the role of the Guardian and protect the Hero who is ascending a tall, treacherous tower's spiral staircase, which is full of mechanical puzzle platforms and enemy shadows that threaten to stop the Hero's ascension. On the team, I was a developer, writing scripts in C#, creating GUI elements, implementing animations, and doing all sorts of fun debugging throughout the creation and production of the game.</p>

        <div class="details">
            <p>In a Media Authoring class, I was tasked with the creation of "a paper doll type mobile phone only app that allows people to design outfits for a character using swipe gestures." This project was the first app I published to Google Play. I enjoyed the challenge of incorporating unique features that utilize the swipe gesture and accelerometer functionality. I coded the entire program in Flash using ActionScript 3.0 and created the background music, sound effects, and animations. I was given the art assets by three teammates and compiled their work into the app. I played the role of team leader and creative director.</p>
